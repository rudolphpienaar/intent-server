[NOTE]
====
**Purpose:** This document presents the Intent-Action Service (IAS) architecture as a path forward that preserves CUBE's Collection+JSON foundation while addressing the client ecosystem challenges we've experienced. It is intended to facilitate internal team discussion and build consensus around a solution that satisfies both the need to maintain our existing investment in Cj and the need to make the platform more accessible.
