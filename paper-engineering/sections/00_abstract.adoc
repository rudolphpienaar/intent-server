Hypermedia APIs adhering to the HATEOAS constraint (REST maturity level 3) have achieved minimal real-world adoption despite decades of advocacy and strong theoretical foundations. Empirical studies consistently show that practitioners abandon hypermedia designs in favor of simpler, task-oriented approaches such as OpenAPI and GraphQL. While this is often attributed to developer preference for procedural clarity over architectural purity, we argue that hypermedia systems did not fail because they were conceptually wrong—they failed because they were *architecturally incomplete*. Pure hypermedia provides declarative resource semantics but lacks a complementary layer for *procedural intent interpretation*, forcing clients to implement complex orchestration logic independently and repeatedly.

The ChRIS medical imaging platform exemplifies this problem at production scale. Its backend, CUBE, was designed around the Collection+JSON hypermedia format to express a fully self-describing graph of computational resources and relationships. Because the core entities—feeds, plugins, files, and users—were well understood early in development, representing them as generic, linkable resources allowed the platform to evolve without breaking its interface. As new clinical and research workflows emerged, they could be incorporated by extending the resource graph rather than redefining the API. This declarative model maximized flexibility and generalizability during ChRIS's formative stages. However, this same design introduced a fundamental impedance mismatch between how CUBE represents information—through linked entities and semantic relationships—and how clients must act: through procedural workflows and task-oriented operations. Every non-trivial operation required clients to traverse the hypermedia graph, interpret link semantics, and construct multi-step orchestration sequences. Over time, each client implementation was forced to recreate its own mapping layer between user intentions and CUBE primitives. This duplication led to fragmentation, maintenance fatigue, and inconsistent behavior across clients, ultimately stagnating client development. The burden shifted entirely to the user interface, which became the sole functional client by embedding orchestration logic within presentation code—a conflation that has now stalled further system evolution.

We analyze three architectural approaches to resolve this impedance mismatch. The first maintains the status quo, accepting continued stagnation. The second embeds intent logic directly within CUBE, centralizing orchestration but coupling fast-changing procedural workflows to the slow-evolving declarative backend. The third introduces an external *Intent-Action Service* (IAS) that interprets high-level procedural intents and translates them into orchestrated CUBE operations. The IAS provides a task-oriented API for common workflows while preserving CUBE's declarative Collection+JSON substrate for resource discovery and semantic richness. This dual-interface design delivers both the discoverability and extensibility of hypermedia and the operational accessibility that clients require. Through comparative analysis across architectural purity, evolutionary velocity, operational complexity, security, and client ecosystem enablement, we demonstrate that the externalized IAS model optimally balances these competing concerns. The external architecture preserves CUBE's declarative purity and enables independent evolution of procedural and semantic layers.

The IAS pattern has implications beyond ChRIS. It offers a potential solution to the HATEOAS adoption problem: hypermedia systems may benefit from exposing *two complementary interfaces*—a declarative hypermedia API for semantic exploration and an intent-driven API for procedural execution. This architectural completion could enable hypermedia APIs to fulfill their original promise while meeting the pragmatic needs that drove practitioners toward simpler alternatives.
