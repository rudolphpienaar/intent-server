== Conclusion

This paper has presented a systematic architectural analysis of the intent-orchestration impedance mismatch in the ChRIS medical imaging platform. The challenge—balancing CUBE's declarative Collection+JSON semantics with clients' procedural workflow needs—exemplifies a broader tension in distributed systems between semantic expressiveness and operational accessibility. Our analysis evaluated three responses: maintaining the current architecture with orchestration embedded in the UI, internalizing intent logic within CUBE, or introducing an external Intent-Action Service (IAS). Through comparative evaluation across architectural purity, evolutionary velocity, operational complexity, security, and ecosystem enablement, the external IAS emerged as the most promising candidate for validation.

=== What We Have Established

The architectural analysis demonstrates several conclusions with reasonable confidence:

**The problem is real and consequential.** Client ecosystem stagnation, UI complexity growth, and maintenance burden are documented consequences of the current architecture. The orchestration logic scattered throughout the ChRIS UI represents both immediate technical debt and long-term evolutionary constraint.

**The alternatives have clear trade-offs.** Maintaining the status quo perpetuates stagnation. Embedding orchestration in CUBE couples fast-changing workflows to slow-evolving backend semantics. The external IAS accepts operational complexity in exchange for separation of concerns and evolutionary independence. These trade-offs are not speculative but follow from established software engineering principles [14][11].

**Incremental validation is feasible.** The IAS approach enables progressive implementation: individual intents can be added, tested, and evaluated without committing to the full architecture. This reduces risk and provides empirical feedback at each stage.

=== What Remains Unknown

However, several critical questions require empirical validation before definitive conclusions are justified:

**Will the IAS actually reduce complexity?** While we hypothesize 40-60% reduction in client code complexity, actual results depend on intent design quality, CUBE API stability, and workflow characteristics. The IAS could relocate complexity rather than eliminate it.

**Will developers adopt the IAS?** Developer experience depends on API usability, documentation quality, error handling, and integration patterns. A well-designed IAS could still fail if the learning curve exceeds perceived benefits or if developers prefer direct CUBE access for flexibility.

**What performance overhead is acceptable?** The additional network hop introduces latency. Whether 200ms overhead is acceptable depends on workflow characteristics, user expectations, and alternative performance optimization strategies. Some operations may require direct CUBE access regardless of IAS availability.

**Can intents truly evolve independently?** While architectural separation suggests independent evolution, intents ultimately depend on CUBE capabilities. Changes to CUBE's resource model may cascade into intent implementations despite service boundaries. The degree of coupling reduction requires longitudinal measurement.

**Does this generalize beyond ChRIS?** The pattern may be ChRIS-specific, reflecting Collection+JSON's particular characteristics and medical imaging workflow requirements. Applicability to other domains remains speculative until validated through additional case studies.

=== Research Agenda and Next Steps

We propose to validate these questions through incremental IAS implementation guided by the research questions and success criteria articulated in Sections 1.3 and 3.7. The validation strategy prioritizes:

**1. Proof of concept (3-5 intents).** Implement representative workflows to validate technical feasibility, measure baseline performance, and refine API design patterns.

**2. UI integration pilot (10-15 intents).** Refactor ChRIS UI components to use IAS endpoints for common operations. Measure code complexity changes, developer velocity, and identify integration challenges.

**3. Ecosystem expansion (diverse clients).** Enable external client development through published APIs and SDKs. Track adoption patterns, developer feedback, and ecosystem growth metrics.

**4. Longitudinal evaluation (12-18 months).** Monitor independent evolution of IAS and CUBE. Measure version coupling, breaking change frequency, and maintenance overhead.

**5. Transparent reporting.** Document outcomes regardless of results—successful validation, partial success with identified limitations, or negative results that inform alternative approaches.

=== Commitment to Evidence-Based Decision Making

A critical aspect of this research agenda is epistemic humility. While the architectural analysis suggests the external IAS is promising, we acknowledge that implementation may reveal unforeseen challenges, costs may exceed benefits, or alternative approaches may prove superior. The validation framework explicitly defines failure criteria—conditions under which we would conclude the IAS approach is not succeeding.

If validation reveals that:
- Client complexity increases rather than decreases
- Performance overhead exceeds acceptable thresholds
- Maintenance burden of dual APIs outweighs benefits
- Developers systematically avoid or bypass the IAS
- Independent evolution fails due to semantic coupling

...then these results constitute valuable contributions to understanding when and how architectural completion strategies succeed or fail. Negative results that prevent others from pursuing unproductive paths serve the research community as effectively as positive results that identify successful patterns.

=== Broader Implications (Conditional)

If validation succeeds, the implications extend beyond ChRIS. The dual-interface pattern—declarative hypermedia for semantic exploration, procedural intents for workflow execution—could address orchestration challenges in other scientific computing platforms, enterprise integration architectures, and systems requiring both machine-readable semantics and human-usable operations [38]. The validation framework itself, with explicit success and failure criteria and commitment to transparent reporting, provides a model for evaluating architectural proposals in production systems where controlled experiments are difficult.

However, these implications remain conditional on successful validation. We resist the temptation to claim broad applicability before demonstrating effectiveness in a single well-understood case.

=== Closing Perspective

The challenge ChRIS faces is neither unique nor fundamentally new. Systems frequently encounter tensions between architectural ideals and operational pragmatism. The question is not whether such tensions exist but how to resolve them productively. Our proposal—completing hypermedia architectures with procedural interpretation layers—appears promising based on systematic analysis. Whether it proves effective in practice depends on implementation quality, deployment context, and whether the anticipated benefits materialize under realistic conditions.

The path forward requires empiricism rather than advocacy. We have articulated a hypothesis, designed a validation framework, and proposed incremental implementation that enables learning at each stage. Success will be measured not by confirming our initial assumptions but by discovering what actually works, why it works, and under what conditions. This paper establishes the foundation for that discovery process.

For the ChRIS project specifically, the IAS represents our best current hypothesis for resolving architectural stagnation while preserving the Collection+JSON foundation that years of development depend upon. For the broader research community, it represents a testable proposal about how to complete hypermedia architectures with the procedural capabilities that clients require. Both purposes are served by rigorous validation and transparent reporting of outcomes.

The Intent-Action Service may prove to be the architectural completion that ChRIS needs—or it may reveal limitations that point toward alternative solutions. Either outcome advances understanding. We proceed with careful optimism, prepared to learn from whatever implementation reveals.
