== Architectural Alternatives Analysis

Three responses exist: *Status quo* accepts client stagnation for operational simplicity (systems failing to reduce coupling experience declining adaptability [Lehman 1980]). *Embedded in CUBE* centralizes orchestration but couples fast-changing workflows to slow-evolving backend, limiting independence and violating separation-of-concerns [Parnas 1972]. *External IAS* provides: evolutionary independence (separate release cycle [Ford et al. 2023]), proper layering (Backend-for-Frontend pattern [Newman 2021]), and client ecosystem enablement (shared orchestration).

Status quo perpetuates stagnation; embedded introduces coupling without addressing UI concerns; only external IAS delivers separation, independence, and ecosystem enablement simultaneously. The orchestration functionality already exists scattered in the UI; IAS makes complexity *managed* rather than *entangled* [Brooks 1987], aligning with modular decomposition [Parnas 1972] and evolutionary architecture principles [Ford et al. 2023].
