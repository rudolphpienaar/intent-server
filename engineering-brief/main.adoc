:revremark: Engineering Brief - Internal Technical Proposal

[NOTE]
====
*Document Purpose:* This engineering brief presents a technical proposal for introducing an Intent-Action Service (IAS) to address architectural limitations in the ChRIS platform. The proposal is grounded in established software engineering principles and includes incremental validation strategy with explicit decision points.

*Target Audience:* ChRIS development team and technical stakeholders

*Length:* This document provides essential technical analysis in approximately 10 pages. For comprehensive academic treatment with full research methodology, see the research paper version.
