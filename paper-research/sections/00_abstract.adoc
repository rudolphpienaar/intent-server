== Abstract

Hypermedia APIs adhering to the HATEOAS constraint have achieved minimal adoption despite strong theoretical foundations. We argue this reflects not conceptual inadequacy but architectural incompleteness: pure hypermedia provides declarative resource semantics but lacks a complementary layer for procedural intent interpretation. The ChRIS medical imaging platform exemplifies this challenge. Its Collection+JSON backend (CUBE) was originally adopted to stabilize the backend from rapid client evolution, providing a general-purpose substrate that multiple diverse clients could consume. In practice, the semantic navigation complexity of Collection+JSON prevented client ecosystem development. The sole functional client—the ChRIS UI—was forced to absorb orchestration logic, conflating presentation and business concerns in ways that have stalled both UI evolution and broader ecosystem growth. A primary motivation for the Intent-Action Service (IAS) proposal is to liberate the UI, refactoring it into a pure presentation platform that can evolve rapidly while enabling the diverse client ecosystem originally envisioned.

We analyze three architectural responses using ChRIS as a case study. Given ChRIS is a production system with active users, institutional dependencies, and years of accumulated domain logic, complete replacement of Collection+JSON is not viable—the risk and cost are prohibitive. We therefore evaluate: maintaining the status quo, embedding intent logic within CUBE, or introducing an external Intent-Action Service (IAS). Through systematic comparison across architectural purity, evolutionary velocity, operational complexity, security, and ecosystem enablement, we identify the external IAS as the most promising approach. Critically, the IAS enables incremental adoption: intents can be added progressively, validated individually, and adopted selectively without requiring wholesale system redesign. One possible outcome is that a successful IAS could eventually subsume Collection+JSON entirely if the procedural layer proves sufficient; alternatively, both layers may coexist long-term serving complementary purposes.

We present this work as a research agenda grounded in practical constraints rather than a completed solution. Five research questions guide our proposed validation: (RQ1) Does IAS reduce client complexity compared to direct hypermedia usage? (RQ2) Does the dual-API approach improve developer experience? (RQ3) What performance overhead does the additional layer introduce? (RQ4) Can intents evolve independently of underlying resources? (RQ5) Does the pattern generalize beyond medical imaging? We propose measurable success and failure criteria including code complexity metrics, developer velocity benchmarks, and performance thresholds. Implementation will proceed incrementally, validating assumptions at each stage. We commit to transparent reporting regardless of outcome, as both positive and negative results contribute to understanding when and how to complete hypermedia architectures with procedural interpretation layers.

The broader contribution extends beyond ChRIS: we propose that successful hypermedia systems may require dual interfaces—declarative APIs for semantic exploration and procedural APIs for workflow execution—and outline a validation framework for testing this hypothesis within the constraints of production systems.
